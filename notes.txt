setup HTTPS:

Cloudflare:
    -> set SSL mode to strict

LetsEncrypt via HA-Addon:
    * need DNS:Zone:edit API token from cloudflare
    -> generate Certs
    -> download Certs

Nginx Proxy Manager:
    -> SSL Certificates
        -> add custom, with certs from LetsEncrypt
            -> destination is the nodeapp:sslport (ex: homeassistant.local:3443)
    -> add proxy host with custom SSL

The image is build locally and pushed to DockerHub.

Then, it is specified in the Addon config.yaml as via image: and also version:
Version needs to match the docker-image tag!!
